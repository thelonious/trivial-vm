Just playing around with a very simple virtual CPU along with a toy language that targets it.

This is being built in Eclipse. You'll need to pull in all projects in the projects directory along with projects from the following repos:

* [beaver](https://github.com/thelonious/beaver)
* [jflex](https://github.com/thelonious/jflex)
* [java-utils](https://github.com/thelonious/java-utils)

These are all my own repos, so they should always be in sync with this project.
